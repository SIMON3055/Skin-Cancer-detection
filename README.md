# Skin-Cancer-detection

Skin cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. In
this study, we aim to develop a robust and accurate skin cancer detection system using deep learning
techniques on the HAM10000 dataset. We propose to investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning,
ensemble learning, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for skin lesion classification. Specifically,
we aim to fine-tune pre-trained CNNs, such as VGG or ResNet, on the HAM10000 dataset using transfer
learning techniques. Additionally, we propose to investigate the effectiveness of combining multiple
CNNs using ensemble learning methods
